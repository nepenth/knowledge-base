Unpopular opinion: Your container images are bad because Dockerfiles is a no man's land.

- Application developers lack the motivation & relevant skills to write optimal Dockerfiles.

- DevOps engineers lack in-depth knowledge of the application stack and up-to-date build best practices.

But both camps can be easily understood! That's a lot of cross-functional knowledge to keep in one's head, especially for a secondary-importance activity such as building good container images.

That's why Kyle and I decided to team up and try to move the needle. If your team is having a hard time building container images, reach out, and we'll provide an expert Dockerfile review.
