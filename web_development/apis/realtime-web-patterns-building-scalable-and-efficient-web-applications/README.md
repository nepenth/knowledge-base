Realtime web patterns are essential for building scalable and efficient web applications that provide a seamless user experience. This knowledge base entry provides an overview of fundamental web development concepts, including HTTP methods, RESTful APIs, and WebSocket connections, to help developers create robust and efficient web applications.

## Technical Content
### HTTP Methods
HTTP methods are used to interact with resources on the server. The most commonly used HTTP methods are:

* **GET**: Retrieves data from the server. Example: `GET /users`
* **POST**: Creates new resources on the server. Example: `POST /users` with JSON payload `{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" }`
* **PUT**: Updates existing resources on the server. Example: `PUT /users/1` with JSON payload `{ "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com" }"`
* **DELETE**: Deletes resources from the server. Example: `DELETE /users/1`

### RESTful APIs
RESTful APIs are an architectural style for designing networked applications. Key characteristics of RESTful APIs include:

* Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Example: `/users`, `/products`, etc.
* HTTP methods are used to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources. Example: `GET /users` retrieves a list of users, while `POST /users` creates a new user.

### WebSocket Connections
WebSocket connections establish a persistent connection between the client and server, allowing for bidirectional communication. Key characteristics of WebSocket connections include:

* Establishes a persistent connection between the client and server. Example: `ws://example.com/socket`
* Allows for bidirectional communication between the client and server. Example: Client sends message to server, server responds with updated data.

## Realtime Web Patterns
To build realtime web applications, developers can use various patterns, including:

* **Polling**: The client sends periodic requests to the server to retrieve updated data.
* **Long Polling**: The client sends a request to the server and keeps the connection open until an update is available.
* **WebSockets**: Establishes a persistent connection between the client and server, allowing for bidirectional communication.
* **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: The server pushes updates to the client as they become available.

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
* Use RESTful APIs to design scalable and efficient web applications.
* Use WebSocket connections to establish bidirectional communication between the client and server.
* Choose the appropriate realtime web pattern based on the application's requirements.
* Consider using caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the server.

**Description:** The image presents a comprehensive visual representation of various web development concepts, including HTTP methods, RESTful APIs, and WebSocket connections. The infographic is structured as a series of interconnected diagrams, each illustrating a specific concept or process.

*   **HTTP Methods**
    *   GET: Retrieves data from the server
        *   Example: `GET /users`
    *   POST: Creates new resources on the server
        *   Example: `POST /users` with JSON payload `{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" }`
    *   PUT: Updates existing resources on the server
        *   Example: `PUT /users/1` with JSON payload `{ "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com" }`
    *   DELETE: Deletes resources from the server
        *   Example: `DELETE /users/1`
*   **RESTful APIs**
    *   Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
        *   Example: `/users`, `/products`, etc.
