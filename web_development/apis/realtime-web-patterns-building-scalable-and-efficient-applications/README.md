Realtime web patterns are essential for building scalable and efficient web applications that provide a seamless user experience. This knowledge base entry explores the fundamental concepts of HTTP methods, RESTful APIs, and WebSocket connections, providing developers with a comprehensive guide to creating robust and efficient realtime web applications.

## Technical Content
### HTTP Methods
HTTP methods are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. The most commonly used HTTP methods include:

* **GET**: Retrieves data from the server.
	+ Example: `GET /users`
* **POST**: Creates new resources on the server.
	+ Example: `POST /users` with JSON payload `{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" }`
* **PUT**: Updates existing resources on the server.
	+ Example: `PUT /users/1` with JSON payload `{ "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com" }`
* **DELETE**: Deletes resources from the server.
	+ Example: `DELETE /users/1`

### RESTful APIs
RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are an architectural style for designing networked applications. They rely on a stateless, client-server architecture where resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). HTTP methods are used to perform CRUD operations on these resources.

* **Resources**: Identified using URIs, such as `/users`, `/products`, etc.
* **HTTP Methods**: Used to perform CRUD operations on resources, such as `GET /users` to retrieve a list of users, or `POST /users` to create a new user.

### WebSocket Connections
WebSocket connections establish a persistent connection between the client and server, allowing for bidirectional communication. This enables realtime updates and efficient data transfer.

* **Connection Establishment**: A WebSocket connection is established using the `ws://` or `wss://` protocol, such as `ws://example.com/socket`.
* **Bidirectional Communication**: The client and server can send messages to each other, enabling realtime updates and efficient data transfer.
	+ Example: Client sends message to server, server responds with updated data.

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
* Use HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on resources.
* Design RESTful APIs using a stateless, client-server architecture.
* Utilize WebSocket connections for bidirectional communication and realtime updates.
* Follow standard URI naming conventions for resource identification.
* Implement error handling and security measures for all API interactions.
