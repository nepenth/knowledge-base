Realtime web patterns refer to the design principles and techniques used to build web applications that provide instantaneous updates and feedback to users. This knowledge base entry explores the fundamental concepts of HTTP methods, RESTful APIs, and WebSocket connections, which are essential for building robust and efficient realtime web applications.

## Technical Content
### HTTP Methods
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods are used to perform specific actions on resources identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). The most commonly used HTTP methods include:

* **GET**: Retrieves data from the server. Example: `GET /users`
* **POST**: Creates new resources on the server. Example: `POST /users` with JSON payload `{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" }`
* **PUT**: Updates existing resources on the server. Example: `PUT /users/1` with JSON payload `{ "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com" }`
* **DELETE**: Deletes resources from the server. Example: `DELETE /users/1`

### RESTful APIs
REST (Representational State of Resource) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server architecture where resources are identified using URIs, and HTTP methods are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these resources.

* **Resources**: Identified using URIs (e.g., `/users`, `/products`)
* **HTTP Methods**: Used to perform CRUD operations on resources (e.g., `GET /users` retrieves a list of users, while `POST /users` creates a new user)

### WebSocket Connections
WebSocket is a protocol that enables bidirectional, real-time communication between a client and a server over the web. It establishes a persistent connection between the client and server, allowing for instantaneous updates and feedback.

* **Establishing a Connection**: Example: `ws://example.com/socket`
* **Bidirectional Communication**: Client sends message to server, server responds with updated data

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
1. **Use HTTP methods correctly**: Ensure that you use the correct HTTP method for each action (e.g., use `GET` for retrieving data, `POST` for creating new resources).
2. **Design RESTful APIs**: Use URIs to identify resources and HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on these resources.
3. **Implement WebSocket connections**: Establish persistent connections between clients and servers to enable bidirectional, real-time communication.

**Description:** The image presents a comprehensive visual representation of various web development concepts, including HTTP methods, RESTful APIs, and WebSocket connections. The infographic is structured as a series of interconnected diagrams, each illustrating a specific concept or process.

*   **HTTP Methods**
    *   GET: Retrieves data from the server
        *   Example: `GET /users`
    *   POST: Creates new resources on the server
        *   Example: `POST /users` with JSON payload `{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" }`
    *   PUT: Updates existing resources on the server
        *   Example: `PUT /users/1` with JSON payload `{ "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com" }`
    *   DELETE: Deletes resources from the server
        *   Example: `DELETE /users/1`
*   **RESTful APIs**
    *   Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
        *   Example: `/users`, `/products`, etc.
    *   HTTP methods are used to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources
        *   Example: `GET /users` retrieves a list of users, while `POST /users` creates a new user
*   **WebSocket Connections**
    *   Establishes a persistent connection between the client and server
        *   Example: `ws://example.com/socket`
    *   Allows for bidirectional communication between the client and server
        *   Example: Client sends message to server, server responds with updated data

In summary, the infographic provides a clear and concise overview of fundamental web development concepts, including HTTP methods, RESTful APIs, and WebSocket connections. By understanding these concepts, developers can build robust and efficient web applications that meet the needs of their users.
