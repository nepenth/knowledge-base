The SQL JOINS cheat sheet is a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing various SQL join types. This technical resource provides a detailed explanation of each join type, including INNER JOIN, FULL JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and more.

#### Technical Content
SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The infographic highlights eight distinct SQL join types:

* **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves rows where there is a match between tables A and B based on a common key.
	+ Example: `SELECT * FROM tableA INNER JOIN tableB ON tableA.id = tableB.id;`
* **FULL JOIN (WITH NULL CHECK)**: Retrieves rows from both tables with no matching records in either table.
	+ Example: `SELECT * FROM tableA FULL OUTER JOIN tableB ON tableA.id = tableB.id;)`
* **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from table A along with matched rows from table B, without any matches resulting in NULL values for column(s) specified in the ON clause.
	+ Example: `SELECT * FROM tableA LEFT JOIN tableB ON tableA.id = tableB.id;`
* **RIGHT JOIN (WITH NULL CHECK)**: Selects rows from table B that lack a corresponding match in table A while isolating only unmatched rows.
	+ Example: `SELECT * FROM tableA RIGHT JOIN tableB ON tableA.id = tableB.id;`

In addition to these join types, the infographic also covers:

* **CROSS JOIN**: Returns the Cartesian product of rows from both tables.
* **SELF JOIN**: Joins a table with itself as if it were two tables.
* **MULTI-JOIN**: Joins more than two tables based on related columns.

#### Key Takeaways and Best Practices
When working with SQL joins, keep in mind:

* Always specify the join type (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to avoid ambiguity.
* Use meaningful table aliases to improve readability.
* Be cautious when using FULL OUTER JOINs, as they can return a large number of rows.
* Consider indexing columns used in join conditions to improve query performance.
