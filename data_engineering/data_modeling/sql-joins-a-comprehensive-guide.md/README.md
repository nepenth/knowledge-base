SQL joins are used to combine data from two or more tables in a relational database, based on a common column between them. This allows for the retrieval of meaningful data that is spread across multiple tables.

## Introduction to SQL Joins
In a relational database, data is typically normalized and stored in separate tables. These tables are designed to be as independent as possible, with relationships between them established using keys. However, to fetch meaningful data, it's often necessary to combine data from multiple tables. This is where SQL joins come in.

## Types of SQL Joins
There are several types of SQL joins, each with its own specific use case:

### Inner Join
An inner join combines records from two tables based on a common column. The result is a new table containing only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
* Example: Combining employee and department tables using a shared "department_id" column.
* Result: A new table containing all matching rows from both tables.

### Left Join
A left join retrieves all records from one table, including unmatched records in the other table. The result is a new table with all records from the left table, and any matching records from the right table.
* Example: Retrieving all employees, regardless of whether they have a corresponding department.
* Result: A new table with all employee records and any matching department information.

### Right Join
A right join combines records from two tables based on a common column, prioritizing one table over the other. The result is a new table containing all matching rows from both tables, with the right-joined table taking precedence.
* Example: Combining customer and order tables using a shared "customer_id" column, favoring customers over orders.
* Result: A new table containing all matching rows from both tables, with the right-joined table taking precedence.

### Full Outer Join
A full outer join combines records from two tables based on a common column, retrieving all records from both tables regardless of matches. The result is a new table containing all employee records and any matching department information, as well as all department records with no matching employees.
* Example: Combining employee and department tables using a shared "department_id" column.
* Result: A new table containing all employee records and any matching department information, as well as all department records with no matching employees.

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
When working with SQL joins, keep the following best practices in mind:

* Always specify the type of join you want to perform (e.g. INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.)
* Use meaningful table aliases to improve readability
* Be mindful of the order of operations when performing multiple joins
* Consider using indexes on columns used in joins to improve performance
