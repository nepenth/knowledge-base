**Description:** This infographic showcases the top 5 use cases for Kafka, a highly scalable data processing platform developed by Apache.

The five use cases are organized into two columns of three each, with accompanying images illustrating how they work. The first column presents:

* "Activity Tracking" - capturing and streaming high-volume user actions like page views and clicks
* "Stream Processing" - transforming real-time data through multi-stage pipelines
* "Messaging" - enabling asynchronous communication between systems with durability and fault tolerance

The second column highlights:

* "Log Aggregation" - centralizing logs as streams for low-latency, distributed data consumption
* "Event Sourcing" - storing state changes as time-ordered events for durable architectures
* "Sketech Newsletter by Nina" - a Sketech newsletter that provides information about Kafka use cases

The infographic was created using LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter) handles @NinaDurann and @HeyNina101, with the Sketech logo displayed in the bottom left corner.
