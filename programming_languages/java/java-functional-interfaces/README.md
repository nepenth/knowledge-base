Java functional interfaces are crucial components of the Java programming language, particularly when working with lambda expressions and method references. These interfaces play a vital role in simplifying code and enhancing readability. This entry delves into some of the most commonly discussed functional interfaces in Java interviews, including `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Supplier`, `Consumer`, and `BiConsumer`.

#### Detailed Technical Content
Java 8 introduced significant changes to the language, with one of the key features being the introduction of lambda expressions and method references. Functional interfaces are at the heart of this feature, serving as targets for these expressions and references.

The following sections outline some important functional interfaces in Java:

##### Runnable Interface
- **Interface:** `Runnable`
- **Method:** `run()`
- **Description:** The `Runnable` interface is a functional interface with a single abstract method (SAM) `run()`. It does not return any result and does not throw checked exceptions. This interface is often used for executing threads.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Hello from Runnable");
  Thread thread = new Thread(task);
  thread.start();
  ```

##### Callable Interface
- **Interface:** `Callable<V>`
- **Method:** `call()`
- **Description:** The `Callable` interface is similar to `Runnable` but can return a result and throw checked exceptions. It's used in scenarios where you need to compute a value that may throw an exception.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Callable<String> task = () -> "Hello from Callable";
  Future<String> result = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(task);
  try {
      System.out.println(result.get());
  } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
      Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
  }
  ```

##### Supplier Interface
- **Interface:** `Supplier<T>`
- **Method:** `get()`
- **Description:** The `Supplier` interface represents a supplier of results. It has a single method `get()` that returns a result.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Supplier<String> greeting = () -> "Hello from Supplier";
  System.out.println(greeting.get());
  ```

##### Consumer Interface
- **Interface:** `Consumer<T>`
- **Method:** `accept(T t)`
- **Description:** The `Consumer` interface represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result. Unlike most other functional interfaces, `Consumer` does not extend from `Function`.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Consumer<String> printer = (str) -> System.out.println(str);
  printer.accept("Hello from Consumer");
  ```

##### BiConsumer Interface
- **Interface:** `BiConsumer<T, U>`
- **Method:** `accept(T t, U u)`
- **Description:** The `BiConsumer` interface represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  BiConsumer<String, String> greeter = (name, surname) -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name + " " + surname);
  greeter.accept("John", "Doe");
  ```

#### Key Takeaways and Best Practices
- Use functional interfaces to simplify your code when working with lambda expressions or method references.
- Choose the appropriate interface based on whether you need to return a value (`Supplier`, `Callable`), consume values (`Consumer`, `BiConsumer`), or execute threads (`Runnable`).
- Consider using `Callable` over `Runnable` when you need to return a result from an asynchronous computation.
- Always handle exceptions appropriately, especially with `Callable` and other interfaces that may throw checked exceptions.

**Description:** The image presents a table with three columns: "Interface", "Method", and "Description". The table is divided into two sections, each containing five rows of data.

**Section 1:**

* **Row 1:** 
	+ Interface: Runnable
	+ Method: run()
	+ Description: No result, no exceptions.
* **Row 2:**
	+ Interface: Callable<V>
	+ Method: call()
	+ Description: Returns result, can throw exceptions.
* **Row 3:**
	+ Interface: Supplier<T>
	+ Method: get()
	+ Description: Provides a result.

**Section 2:**

* **Row 4:**
	+ Interface: Consumer<T>
	+ Method: accept(T)
	+ Description: Consumes an input.
* **Row 5:**
	+ Interface: BiConsumer<T, U>
	+ Method: accept(T, U)
	+ Description: Consumes two inputs.

**Summary:**

The table provides a concise overview of various interfaces and methods in Java, along with their descriptions. The data is organized into two sections, each containing five rows of information. The interfaces include Runnable, Callable, Supplier, Consumer, and BiConsumer, while the methods are run(), call(), get(), accept(T), and accept(T, U). The descriptions offer a brief explanation of what each interface and method does. Overall, the table serves as a useful reference for understanding the different interfaces and methods available in Java programming.
