Effective logging is crucial for efficient debugging, troubleshooting, and maintenance of software systems. Good logs provide valuable information that leads to a fix, whereas bad logs are just noise that can hinder the debugging process. This article outlines 7 rules of thumb for effective logging, highlighting best practices and tools that support these principles.

#### Technical Content
##### Rule 1: Use Structured Logging
Structured logging involves formatting log entries in a way that enables easy parsing and processing by tools and automation systems. This is typically achieved using a standardized format such as JSON or XML. For example:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User logged in successfully",
  "correlationId": "1234567890"
}
```
##### Rule 2: Include Unique Identifiers
Each log entry should include a unique identifier, such as a correlation ID, request ID, or transaction ID. This enables tracing requests across distributed services and facilitates debugging. For instance:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User logged in successfully",
  "correlationId": "1234567890",
  "requestId": "abcdefg"
}
```
##### Rule 3: Keep Log Entries Small, Easy to Read, and Useful
Log entries should be concise and focused on the most important information. Avoid overloading logs with unnecessary data, as this can make them difficult to read and parse. For example:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "message": "Database connection failed"
}
```
##### Rule 4: Standardize Timestamps
Use consistent time zones (preferably UTC) and formats for timestamps. This ensures that logs can be easily compared and analyzed across different systems and locations. For instance:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User logged in successfully"
}
```
##### Rule 5: Categorize Log Levels
Log levels should be categorized to provide clear distinctions between different types of log entries. Common categories include:
* **Debug**: Detailed technical information for troubleshooting during development.
* **Info**: High-level operational information.
* **Error**: Critical issues requiring attention.

Example:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "DEBUG",
  "message": "Database query executed successfully"
}
```
##### Rule 6: Include Contextual Information
Contextual details, such as user ID, session ID, and environment-specific identifiers, make debugging easier by providing a clear understanding of the context in which an event occurred. For example:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User logged in successfully",
  "userId": "johnDoe",
  "sessionId": "abcdefg",
  "environment": "production"
}
```
##### Rule 7: Protect Sensitive Information
Sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and personally identifiable information (PII), should not be logged. If logging sensitive data is unavoidable, it should be masked, redacted, or hashed to protect users and systems.

#### Key Takeaways and Best Practices
* Use structured logging formats, such as JSON or XML.
* Include unique identifiers, such as correlation IDs or request IDs.
* Keep log entries small, easy to read, and useful.
* Standardize timestamps using consistent time zones (preferably UTC) and formats.
* Categorize log levels to provide clear distinctions between different types of log entries.
* Include contextual information, such as user ID, session ID, and environment-specific identifiers.
* Protect sensitive information by masking, redacting, or hashing it.
