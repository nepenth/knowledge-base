**Description:** The image presents a comprehensive overview of concurrency concepts, focusing on parallelism and its limitations. It illustrates various scenarios where concurrency is not parallelism, providing a clear visual representation to help readers understand these complex concepts.

* **Concurrency**
	+ Definition: The ability of multiple tasks or processes to be executed simultaneously.
	+ Importance: Concurrency is essential for improving system performance by maximizing CPU utilization.
* **Not Concurrent, Not Parallel**
	+ Description: A scenario where two tasks are executed one after the other without any overlap in time.
	+ Illustration: A simple diagram showing a single task being performed sequentially, with no concurrent execution.
* **Concurrent, Not Parallel**
	+ Description: A scenario where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously using a shared resource or thread.
	+ Illustration: A diagram depicting two tasks sharing a common thread, illustrating the concept of concurrency without parallelism.
* **Parallelism**
	+ Definition: The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously using separate resources or threads.
	+ Importance: Parallelism is crucial for achieving true concurrent execution and improving system performance.
* **Concurrency is Not Parallelism**
	+ Description: An explanation of why concurrency does not necessarily imply parallelism, highlighting the need for careful resource management.
	+ Illustration: A diagram showing how two tasks can be executed concurrently using a shared resource, but not in parallel due to synchronization issues.

In summary, the image effectively communicates the distinction between concurrency and parallelism, emphasizing that concurrency alone is insufficient to achieve true parallel execution. By illustrating different scenarios and highlighting their limitations, the image provides valuable insights into the complexities of concurrent programming and the importance of proper resource management for optimal system performance.
