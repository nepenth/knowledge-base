Top 8 data structures we use every day:

Data structures are the building blocks of software, helping to organize and store information efficiently.

They are not just theoretical concepts; they are used in the applications that we interact with daily.

Here are some real-world examples of how these data structures are used:

 List

Online shopping cart — an ordered collection of items with the ability to access items at specific positions.

 Linked List

Browser history — enables quick and efficient traversal backward and forward through the history.

 Hash Table

Caching — Many caching algorithms, like in web browsers and content delivery systems, use hash tables to quickly look up values based on a key.

 Stack

Undo functionality — Last In, First Out (LIFO) the last element added is the first one to be removed.

 Queue

Printer queue — follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, print jobs are processed in the order they are received.

 Graph

Social media network — helps in suggesting new friends, finding mutual connections, and disseminating posts through the network.

 Matrix

Pathfinding — utilizes a two-dimensional array to represent a grid and determine the shortest path from one point to another.

 Tree

File system — trees are hierarchical in nature, mirroring the organizational structure of directories and subdirectories. Many file systems are represented as trees with directories as nodes.

 Heap

Priority queue — efficiently ensures that the element with the highest priority is always readily accessible.

Of course, these are just a few examples of the many data structures used in software engineering.

Understanding how and where to use these data structures is a fundamental skill for any software engineer to create effective and efficient solutions.

 I’d love to hear your thoughts. What data structures or use cases would you like to add?
