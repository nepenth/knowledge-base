Building a robust and scalable RESTful API requires careful consideration of several key factors, including HTTP status codes, idempotence, query languages, authentication, versioning, semantic path design, domain model driven design, and HTTP methods. This guide provides a detailed overview of these concepts, along with examples and best practices to help developers create high-quality APIs.

## Technical Content
### HTTP Status Codes
HTTP status codes are used to communicate the outcome of a request to the client. A list of common HTTP status codes includes:
* 200: OK
* 201: Created
* 204: No Content
* 301: Moved Permanently
* 302: Found
* 307: Temporary Redirect
* 400: Bad Request
* 401: Unauthorized
* 403: Forbidden
* 404: Not Found
* 405: Method Not Allowed
* 406: Not Acceptable
* 408: Request Timeout
* 409: Conflict
* 410: Gone
* 411: Length Required
* 412: Precondition Failed
* 413: Payload Too Large
* 414: URI Too Long
* 415: Unsupported Media Type

Example:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe"
}
```

### Idempotence
Idempotence refers to the ability of an API to produce the same result when a request is repeated. This is particularly important for operations that modify data, such as `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests.

Example:
```http
// Initial request
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe"
}

// Repeated request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe"
}
```

### Query Languages
Query languages, such as SQL or GraphQL, can be used to filter and sort data in an API. Pagination is also essential for limiting the amount of data returned.

Example:
```http
// GET request with query parameters
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Jane Doe"
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "pagination": {
            "page": 1,
            "perPage": 10,
            "totalPages": 5
        }
    }
}
```

### Authentication
Authentication is critical for securing an API. Common methods include OAuth2, API keys, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Example:
```http
// Authorization header with JWT token
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaGFuIjoiMjMwfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

### Versioning
Versioning is essential for maintaining backward compatibility with previous versions of an API. This can be achieved through the use of version numbers in URLs or headers.

Example:
```http
// GET request with version number in URL
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Jane Doe"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Semantic Path Design
Semantic path design refers to the use of intuitive and descriptive URLs for API endpoints.

Example:
```http
// GET request with semantic URL
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Jane Doe"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Domain Model Driven Design
Domain model driven design involves creating API endpoints that reflect real-world entities and their relationships.

Example:
```http
// GET request with domain model driven URL
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe",
            "address": {
                "street": "123 Main St",
                "city": "Anytown",
                "state": "CA",
                "zip": "12345"
            }
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Jane Doe",
            "address": {
                "street": "456 Elm St",
                "city": "Othertown",
                "state": "NY",
                "zip": "67890"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### HTTP Methods
HTTP methods, such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`, are used to perform different operations on resources.

Example:
```http
// GET request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Jane Doe"
        }
    ]
}

// POST request
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "data": {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Bob Smith"
    }
}
```
