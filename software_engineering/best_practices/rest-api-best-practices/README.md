### Description
Building robust and scalable RESTful APIs requires careful consideration of several key factors, including HTTP status codes, idempotence, query languages, authentication, versioning, semantic path design, domain model-driven design, and HTTP methods. This article provides a comprehensive overview of best practices for designing and implementing RESTful APIs.

### Technical Content
#### HTTP Status Codes
HTTP status codes are used to communicate the outcome of a request. There are 20 standard HTTP status codes, including:

* 200: OK
* 201: Created
* 204: No Content
* 301: Moved Permanently
* 302: Found
* 307: Temporary Redirect
* 400: Bad Request
* 401: Unauthorized
* 403: Forbidden
* 404: Not Found
* 405: Method Not Allowed
* 406: Not Acceptable
* 408: Request Timeout
* 409: Conflict
* 410: Gone
* 411: Length Required
* 412: Precondition Failed
* 413: Payload Too Large
* 414: URI Too Long
* 415: Unsupported Media Type

Example use case:
```http
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
```
Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

#### Idempotence
Idempotence ensures that repeated requests yield the same result. This is particularly important for HTTP methods like `PUT` and `DELETE`, which can have unintended consequences if repeated.

Example use case:
```http
PUT /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
}
```
Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
}
```

#### Query Languages
Query languages like pagination, filtering, and sorting enable clients to request specific data from the server.

Example use case:
```http
GET /users?limit=10&offset=0&sort=name HTTP/1.1
```
Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice Smith",
        "email": "alice.smith@example.com"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob Johnson",
        "email": "bob.johnson@example.com"
    }
]
```

#### Authentication
Authentication mechanisms like OAuth2, API keys, and JWT ensure that only authorized clients can access protected resources.

Example use case:
```http
GET /protected-resource HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "message": "Hello, authenticated user!"
}
```

#### Versioning
Versioning ensures that changes to the API do not break existing clients. This can be achieved through URL versioning (e.g., `/v1/users`) or header versioning (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`).

Example use case:
```http
GET /v2/users HTTP/1.1
```
Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice Smith",
        "email": "alice.smith@example.com"
    }
]
```

#### Semantic Path Design
Semantic path design ensures that endpoint URLs are intuitive and easy to understand.

Example use case:
```http
GET /users/123/orders HTTP/1.1
```
Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "user_id": 123,
        "total": 100.00
    }
]
```

#### Domain Model-Driven Design
Domain model-driven design ensures that the API reflects real-world entities and their relationships.

Example use case:
```http
GET /customers/123/orders HTTP/1.1
```
Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "customer_id": 123,
        "total": 100.00
    }
]
```

#### HTTP Methods
HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` are used to manipulate resources.

Example use case:
```http
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```
Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /users/123

{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Key Takeaways and Best Practices

* Use meaningful HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of a request.
* Ensure that all endpoints are clearly defined and consistent across the API.
* Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce latency.
* Use versioning to ensure backward compatibility with previous versions of the API.
* Design intuitive endpoint URLs using semantic path design principles.
* Reflect real-world entities and their relationships in the API using domain model-driven design principles.
* Use HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` to manipulate resources.
