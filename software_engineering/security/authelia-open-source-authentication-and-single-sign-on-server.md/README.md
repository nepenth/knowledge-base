Authelia is an open-source authentication server that provides two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, supporting multiple protocols such as OAuth and OpenID Connect.

#### Technical Overview
Authelia is designed to be a robust and flexible authentication solution for applications. At its core, it allows users to authenticate using various methods, including passwords and two-factor authentication. The SSO feature enables users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials, streamlining the login process and improving user experience.

The development of Authelia involves several programming languages, including:
- Java
- Python
- Go

Each of these languages contributes to different aspects of Authelia's functionality, such as backend logic, API integrations, and frontend interactions. The support for multiple languages reflects Authelia's open-source nature, allowing developers from various backgrounds to contribute and customize the tool according to their needs.

#### Key Features
1. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhances security by requiring a second form of verification, in addition to a password, to access applications.
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to log in once and access multiple applications without needing to re-enter credentials.
3. **Multi-Protocol Support**: Supports OAuth, OpenID Connect, and other authentication protocols, making it adaptable to different application ecosystems.

#### Benefits
The use of Authelia can significantly improve an application's security posture by implementing robust authentication mechanisms. Additionally, the convenience of SSO enhances user experience, potentially leading to higher adoption rates of secured applications.

#### Examples and Use Cases
