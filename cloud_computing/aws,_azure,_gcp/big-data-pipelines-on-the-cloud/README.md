Big data pipelines on the cloud refer to the series of processes and systems used to ingest, process, and analyze large volumes of data stored on cloud-based infrastructure. The three major cloud providers - AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - offer a range of services that can be used to build and manage big data pipelines.

## Technical Overview
A typical big data pipeline consists of four stages: ingestion, data lake, computation, and data warehouse. Each stage involves the use of specific cloud-based services, which vary depending on the provider.

### AWS Big Data Pipeline
The AWS big data pipeline includes:
* **Ingestion**: AWS IoT and Kinesis Stream for real-time data ingestion
* **Data Lake**: S3 and Glacier for storing and archiving large volumes of data
* **Computation**: EMR, Redshift, and DynamoDB for processing and analyzing data
* **Data Warehouse**: Athena and QuickSight for querying and visualizing data

### Azure Big Data Pipeline
The Azure big data pipeline includes:
* **Ingestion**: IoT Hub and Event Hubs for real-time data ingestion
* **Data Lake**: Azure Data Lake Store and Blob Storage for storing and managing large volumes of data
* **Computation**: Databricks, Cosmos DB, and SQL Database for processing and analyzing data
* **Data Warehouse**: Power BI and Azure Synapse Analytics for querying and visualizing data

### GCP Big Data Pipeline
The GCP big data pipeline includes:
* **Ingestion**: Cloud Functions and Pub/Sub for real-time data ingestion
* **Data Lake**: BigQuery and Cloud Storage for storing and managing large volumes of data
* **Computation**: Cloud AI Platform and Cloud SQL for processing and analyzing data
* **Data Warehouse**: Looker and Google Data Studio for querying and visualizing data

## Examples and Use Cases
For example, a company that collects sensor data from IoT devices can use the AWS big data pipeline to ingest the data into Kinesis Stream, store it in S3, process it using EMR, and analyze it using Redshift. Similarly, a company that uses Azure can ingest data into IoT Hub, store it in Azure Data Lake Store, process it using Databricks, and analyze it using Power BI.

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
When building big data pipelines on the cloud, consider the following best practices:
* Choose the right cloud provider based on your specific needs and requirements
* Use a combination of services to build a scalable and secure pipeline
* Monitor and optimize your pipeline regularly to ensure performance and cost-effectiveness
* Consider using serverless computing options like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions to reduce costs
