Big data pipelines on the cloud refer to the series of processes that enable the ingestion, processing, and analysis of large datasets on cloud-based infrastructure. This knowledge base entry provides an overview of the big data pipelines for three prominent cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Technical Content
The big data pipeline for each cloud provider can be divided into four stages: ingestion, data lake, computation, and data warehouse.

### AWS Big Data Pipeline
* **Ingestion**: AWS provides several services for ingesting data into the pipeline, including:
	+ AWS IoT: for ingesting data from IoT devices
	+ Kinesis Stream: for ingesting streaming data
* **Data Lake**: AWS offers the following services for storing and managing raw, unprocessed data:
	+ S3: a highly durable object store
	+ Glacier: a low-cost, long-term archive storage service
* **Computation**: AWS provides several services for processing and analyzing data, including:
	+ EMR: a managed Hadoop service for processing large datasets
	+ Redshift: a fully managed data warehouse service
	+ DynamoDB: a fast, fully managed NoSQL database service
* **Data Warehouse**: AWS offers the following services for analyzing and visualizing data:
	+ Athena: a serverless query service for analyzing data in S3
	+ QuickSight: a fast, cloud-powered business intelligence service

### Azure Big Data Pipeline
* **Ingestion**: Azure provides several services for ingesting data into the pipeline, including:
	+ IoT Hub: for ingesting data from IoT devices
	+ Event Hubs: for ingesting streaming data
* **Data Lake**: Azure offers the following services for storing and managing raw, unprocessed data:
	+ Azure Data Lake Store: a highly scalable object store
	+ Blob Storage: a highly available object store
* **Computation**: Azure provides several services for processing and analyzing data, including:
	+ Databricks: a fast, easy, and collaborative Apache Spark-based analytics platform
	+ Cosmos DB: a globally distributed, multi-model database service
	+ SQL Database: a fully managed relational database service
* **Data Warehouse**: Azure offers the following services for analyzing and visualizing data:
	+ Power BI: a business analytics service
	+ Azure Synapse Analytics: a limitless analytics service

### GCP Big Data Pipeline
* **Ingestion**: GCP provides several services for ingesting data into the pipeline, including:
	+ Cloud Functions: a serverless compute service for ingesting event-driven data
	+ Pub/Sub: a messaging service for ingesting streaming data
* **Data Lake**: GCP offers the following services for storing and managing raw, unprocessed data:
	+ BigQuery: a fully managed enterprise data warehouse service
	+ Cloud Storage: a highly durable object store
* **Computation**: GCP provides several services for processing and analyzing data, including:
	+ Cloud AI Platform: a managed platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models
	+ Cloud SQL: a fully managed relational database service
* **Data Warehouse**: GCP offers the following services for analyzing and visualizing data:
	+ Looker: a cloud-based business intelligence platform
	+ Google Data Studio: a free tool for creating interactive, web-based data visualizations

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
When designing a big data pipeline on the cloud, consider the following best practices:

* **Choose the right ingestion service**: Select an ingestion service that matches the characteristics of your data source.
* **Use a scalable data lake**: Choose a data lake that can scale to meet the needs of your growing dataset.
* **Select the right computation service**: Select a computation service that matches the processing requirements of your workload.
* **Use a managed data warehouse service**: Consider using a fully managed data warehouse service to simplify the analysis and visualization of your data.
