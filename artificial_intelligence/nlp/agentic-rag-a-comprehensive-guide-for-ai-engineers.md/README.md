Agentic RAG (Retrieve, Augment, Generate) is an advanced framework used in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries. Unlike simple naive RAG systems, Agentic RAG incorporates agency into the system, allowing it to adapt to different use cases and provide better results.

## Technical Overview
Agentic RAG involves several key components and processes:

1. **Analysis of the User Query**: The original user query is passed to a Large Language Model (LLM) based agent for analysis. This agent can rewrite the query multiple times to create single or multiple queries to be passed down the pipeline. It also decides if additional data sources are required to answer the query.
2. **Retrieval Step**: If additional data is needed, the Retrieval step is triggered. In Agentic RAG, a single or multiple agents can figure out what data sources should be tapped into. Examples of data sources include:
	* Real-time user data (e.g., current location)
	* Internal documents
	* Data available on the web
3. **Composition of the Answer**: If no additional data is required, the system tries to compose an answer (or multiple answers or a set of actions) straight via an LLM.
4. **Analysis and Evaluation of the Answer**: The generated answer gets analyzed, summarized, and evaluated for correctness and relevance. If the agent decides the answer is good enough, it is returned to the user. Otherwise, the system attempts to rewrite the user query and repeat the generation loop.

## Key Components
The real power of Agentic RAG lies in its ability to perform additional routing pre and post-generation, handle multiple distinct data sources for retrieval if needed, and recover from failures while generating correct answers. The Reflection pattern is a crucial aspect of this process, allowing the system to reflect on its performance and adjust accordingly.

## Examples and Use Cases
Agentic RAG can be applied in various scenarios, including but not limited to:
* **Customer Service Chatbots**: Agentic RAG can help chatbots provide more accurate and personalized responses to customer queries by leveraging real-time user data and internal knowledge bases.
* **Virtual Assistants**: Virtual assistants can utilize Agentic RAG to offer more relevant and context-specific suggestions based on the user's current location, schedule, and preferences.

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
When implementing Agentic RAG, consider the following best practices:
* **Think in Systems and Engineering Flows**: Approach Agentic RAG as a system that requires careful design and integration of multiple components.
* **Adapt to Your Use Case**: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to adding agency to your RAG system. Be prepared to adapt and customize the framework according to your specific needs.
* **Monitor and Evaluate Performance**: Continuously monitor and evaluate the performance of your Agentic RAG system, making adjustments as needed to ensure optimal results.

**Description:** The infographic, titled "Agentic RAG," illustrates a flowchart for querying information from an intelligent system. The chart consists of four stages:

1. **Chat Interface**: This is where users interact with the system by submitting queries.
2. **Data Sources**: These are the sources that provide the necessary data to answer user queries.
3. **LLM Agent**: A Large Language Model (LLM) agent processes the query and generates a response based on its training data.
4. **Response Generation**: The LLM agent's response is then generated, which may include additional information or context.

The flowchart also includes arrows indicating the possible paths that the user can take after receiving a response:

* If the response is satisfactory, the user can submit another query.
* If the response is not satisfactory, the user can request additional data or clarification from the LLM agent.

Overall, the infographic provides a clear and concise overview of the Agentic RAG system's architecture and functionality.
