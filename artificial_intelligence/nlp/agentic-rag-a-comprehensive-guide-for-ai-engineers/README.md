Agentic RAG (Retrieve, Augment, Generate) is an advanced framework used in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries. This guide aims to provide a detailed overview of Agentic RAG, its components, and how it works.

## Technical Content
Agentic RAG is an extension of the traditional RAG system, which involves simple retrieval and generation of text based on user input. However, in real-world applications, this approach often falls short due to the complexity and variability of user queries. Agentic RAG addresses these limitations by introducing agency into the system, allowing it to adapt and improve its responses based on the context and intent behind the query.

The Agentic RAG framework consists of four primary stages:

1. **Analysis of the User Query**: In this stage, the original user query is passed through a Large Language Model (LLM) based agent for analysis. The agent may rewrite the query multiple times to create single or multiple queries that can be processed further.
2. **Retrieval Step**: If additional data is required to answer the query, the retrieval step is triggered. This may involve tapping into various data sources such as real-time user data, internal documents, web data, and more.
3. **Composition of the Answer**: If no additional data is needed, the system attempts to compose an answer (or multiple answers) directly via an LLM.
4. **Analysis, Summarization, and Evaluation**: The generated answer undergoes analysis for correctness and relevance. If deemed satisfactory, it is returned to the user; otherwise, the query may be rewritten, and the generation loop repeated.

### Example Use Case
Consider a user asking a virtual assistant for recommendations on nearby restaurants based on their current location. The Agentic RAG system would:

- Analyze the user's query to understand the intent (finding restaurants) and context (current location).
- Trigger the retrieval step to fetch real-time data about the user's location and possibly internal data on restaurant reviews.
- Use an LLM to generate a list of recommended restaurants based on the retrieved data.
- Evaluate the response for accuracy and relevance before presenting it to the user.

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
- **Understand User Intent**: The success of Agentic RAG heavily relies on accurately understanding the user's intent behind their query.
- **Adaptability is Key**: Be prepared to adapt your system based on the specific use case, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to adding agency to a RAG system.
- **Think in Systems and Engineering Flows**: Approach Agentic RAG with a systemic view, considering how different components interact and influence each other.

**Description:** The infographic, titled "Agentic RAG," illustrates a flowchart for querying information from an intelligent system. The chart consists of four stages:

1. **Chat Interface**: This is where users interact with the system by submitting queries.
2. **Data Sources**: These are the sources that provide the necessary data to answer user queries.
3. **LLM Agent**: A Large Language Model (LLM) agent processes the query and generates a response based on its training data.
4. **Response Generation**: The LLM agent's response is then generated, which may include additional information or context.

The flowchart also includes arrows indicating the possible paths that the user can take after receiving a response:

* If the response is satisfactory, the user can submit another query.
* If the response is not satisfactory, the user can request additional data or clarification from the LLM agent.

Overall, the infographic provides a clear and concise overview of the Agentic RAG system's architecture and functionality.
