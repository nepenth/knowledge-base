## Description
Agentic RAG (Retrieve, Augment, Generate) is an advanced framework used in natural language processing (NLP) to generate accurate and relevant responses to user queries. Unlike simple naive RAG systems, Agentic RAG incorporates agency into the system, allowing it to adapt to different use cases and provide more effective results.

### Overview of Agentic RAG

Agentic RAG is a sophisticated system that involves multiple components working together to generate responses to user queries. The process can be broken down into several stages:

1. **Analysis of the User Query**: The original user query is passed to a Large Language Model (LLM) based agent for analysis. This agent may rewrite the query, sometimes multiple times, to create either a single or multiple queries to be passed down the pipeline.
2. **Retrieval Step**: If additional data is required to answer the query, the retrieval step is triggered. In Agentic RAG, there can be a single or multiple agents responsible for figuring out what data sources should be tapped into. Examples of data sources include:
	* Real-time user data (e.g., current location)
	* Internal documents
	* Data available on the web
3. **Composition of the Answer**: If no additional data is required, the system attempts to compose the answer straight via an LLM.
4. **Analysis and Evaluation**: The generated answer is analyzed, summarized, and evaluated for correctness and relevance. If the agent decides that the answer needs improvement, it may rewrite the user query and repeat the generation loop.

### Key Components of Agentic RAG

* **LLM Agent**: A Large Language Model (LLM) agent plays a crucial role in processing the user query and generating a response based on its training data.
* **Data Sources**: The system can tap into various data sources, including real-time user data, internal documents, and web data, to provide more accurate and relevant responses.
* **Reflection Pattern**: Agentic RAG incorporates a reflection pattern, which allows the system to recover from failures while generating correct answers.

### Examples and Use Cases

Agentic RAG can be applied in various scenarios, such as:

* **Customer Service Chatbots**: Agentic RAG can be used to power customer service chatbots, providing more accurate and relevant responses to user queries.
* **Virtual Assistants**: The framework can be integrated into virtual assistants, enabling them to better understand user intent and provide more effective results.

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices

* **Adapt to Your Use Case**: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to implementing Agentic RAG. It's essential to adapt the system to your specific use case.
* **Think in Systems and Engineering Flows**: When designing an Agentic RAG system, consider the entire workflow and how different components interact with each other.
* **Monitor and Evaluate Performance**: Continuously monitor and evaluate the performance of your Agentic RAG system to identify areas for improvement.

**Description:** The infographic, titled "Agentic RAG," illustrates a flowchart for querying information from an intelligent system. The chart consists of four stages:

1. **Chat Interface**: This is where users interact with the system by submitting queries.
2. **Data Sources**: These are the sources that provide the necessary data to answer user queries.
3. **LLM Agent**: A Large Language Model (LLM) agent processes the query and generates a response based on its training data.
4. **Response Generation**: The LLM agent's response is then generated, which may include additional information or context.

The flowchart also includes arrows indicating the possible paths that the user can take after receiving a response:

* If the response is satisfactory, the user can submit another query.
* If the response is not satisfactory, the user can request additional data or clarification from the LLM agent.

Overall, the infographic provides a clear and concise overview of the Agentic RAG system's architecture and functionality.
