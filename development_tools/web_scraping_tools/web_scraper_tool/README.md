Firecraw is an open-source framework that enables users to convert any website into Large Language Model (LLM)-ready data in just 2 minutes. This tool simplifies the process of extracting clean, structured data from websites, handling complexities such as proxies, anti-bots, and dynamic content.

## Technical Content
Firecraw takes a URL as input, crawls the website, and converts the data into a clean markdown or structured format. The framework offers several features that make it a game-changer in web scraping:
* **LLM-ready formats**: Firecraw outputs data in markdown, HTML, and other structured formats, making it easily consumable by LLMs.
* **Handling complexity**: The tool can handle proxies, anti-bots, and dynamic content, ensuring accurate data extraction even from complex websites.
* **Customizability**: Users can exclude specific tags, headers, or depth levels to tailor the output to their needs.
* **Reliability**: Firecraw provides accurate and consistent results, making it a reliable choice for web scraping tasks.
* **Batching**: The tool allows users to scrape thousands of URLs in batches, streamlining large-scale data extraction projects.
* **Media parsing**: Firecraw can parse media files such as PDFs, DOCX, and images, expanding its capabilities beyond text-based data extraction.
* **Actions**: The framework supports actions like click, scroll, input, and wait, enabling users to interact with websites programmatically.
