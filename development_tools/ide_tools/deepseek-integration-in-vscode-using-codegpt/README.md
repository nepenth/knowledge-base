This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to integrate DeepSeek R1 with VSCode using CodeGPT, enabling developers to leverage the powerful capabilities of the DeepSeek AI model directly within their integrated development environment (IDE).

#### Technical Content
To connect DeepSeek R1 in VSCode with CodeGPT, follow these steps:

1. **Select "LLMs Cloud model"**: Begin by accessing the relevant settings or menu options within CodeGPT that allow you to select or configure Large Language Models (LLMs). Choose the option that specifies using an LLMs cloud model.
2. **Choose DeepSeek as the provider**: From the list of available providers, select DeepSeek as your preferred AI service. This step ensures that you are connecting to the DeepSeek ecosystem.
3. **Pick the "deepseek-reasoner" model**: Once DeepSeek is selected as your provider, you will have access to various models offered by DeepSeek. For this integration, choose the "deepseek-reasoner" model, which is specifically designed for reasoning and coding tasks.
4. **Select code and/or files from your project**: After selecting the appropriate model, you can proceed to select specific parts of your project that you wish to analyze or work on with DeepSeek R1. This could involve highlighting a block of code in your current file or selecting entire files from your project directory.
5. **Send them to the model**: With your selections made, initiate the process to send these chosen elements to the DeepSeek model for analysis, suggestions, or whatever functionality you intend to utilize.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a developer working on a complex JavaScript project in VSCode. They have a particular function that they believe could be optimized but are unsure how. By following the steps outlined above and selecting this function's code block, they can send it to the DeepSeek R1 model via CodeGPT for analysis and recommendations.

#### Key Takeaways and Best Practices
- **Ensure Compatibility**: Always check that your version of CodeGPT is up-to-date before attempting to integrate with DeepSeek R1. Outdated versions may not support the latest features or could lead to compatibility issues.
- **Model Selection**: The choice of model (in this case, "deepseek-reasoner") is crucial for achieving the desired outcomes from your interaction with DeepSeek AI. Select models based on the specific requirements of your project tasks.
- **Data Security**: When sending code snippets or files to external services like DeepSeek R1, ensure you are not inadvertently exposing sensitive data or intellectual property. Review what you're sending and consider anonymizing data where possible.

**Description:** This image depicts a screenshot of a computer screen displaying multiple windows open simultaneously.

The top-left window is labeled "CODEGPT CHAT" and appears to be an interface for interacting with a chatbot or AI assistant. The other windows are arranged in a grid, featuring various icons at the bottom that suggest they may be related to coding or programming tools.

On the right side of the screen, a code snippet is visible, written in JavaScript. This suggests that the user is actively working on a software development project and has multiple applications open to facilitate their work.
