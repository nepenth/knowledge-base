This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to integrate DeepSeek R1 into Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using CodeGPT, enabling developers to leverage the power of DeepSeek's AI models directly within their coding environment.

#### Technical Content
To connect DeepSeek R1 in VSCode with CodeGPT, follow these steps:

1. **Select "LLMs Cloud model"**: Begin by accessing the CodeGPT interface within VSCode and selecting the option for LLMs (Large Language Models) Cloud models. This step is crucial as it directs you to the cloud-based AI models available for integration.
2. **Choose DeepSeek as the provider**: From the list of available providers, choose DeepSeek. This selection specifies that you want to use DeepSeek's AI capabilities within your VSCode environment.
3. **Pick the "deepseek-reasoner" model**: After selecting DeepSeek as your provider, you will be prompted to choose a specific model. Opt for the "deepseek-reasoner" model, which is designed to provide advanced reasoning and code analysis capabilities.
4. **Select code and/or files from your project and send them to the model**: Once the model is selected, you can choose specific parts of your code or entire files that you want the DeepSeek model to analyze or work with. This could be for purposes such as code review, bug detection, or even AI-assisted coding.

#### Example Use Case
For instance, if you are working on a JavaScript project and encounter an issue that you're having trouble resolving, you can select the relevant parts of your `app.js` file and send them to the DeepSeek model for analysis. The model can then provide insights or suggestions based on its understanding of the code and the issue at hand.

#### Key Takeaways and Best Practices
- **Ensure you are using the latest version of CodeGPT**: To integrate DeepSeek R1 successfully, it's crucial to update CodeGPT to its latest version, as compatibility and functionality are continually improved.
- **Explore DeepSeek's Capabilities**: DeepSeek offers a range of AI-powered tools. Exploring these can help you understand how best to utilize them in your development workflow.
- **Security Considerations**: When integrating any external service or model into your development environment, consider the security implications, especially when dealing with sensitive code or data.
