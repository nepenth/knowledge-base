This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to integrate DeepSeek R1 with VSCode using CodeGPT, enabling developers to leverage the powerful capabilities of the DeepSeek AI model directly within their Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

#### Technical Content
To connect DeepSeek R1 to VSCode using CodeGPT, follow these steps:

1. **Select "LLMs Cloud model"**: Begin by selecting the option for Large Language Models (LLMs) cloud models in your CodeGPT settings or preferences. This option may vary slightly depending on the version of CodeGPT you are using.
2. **Choose DeepSeek as the Provider**: From the list of available providers, choose DeepSeek. This step is crucial as it specifies that you want to use the DeepSeek AI model for your coding assistance needs.
3. **Pick the "deepseek-reasoner" Model**: After selecting DeepSeek as your provider, you will be prompted to choose a specific model. Select the "deepseek-reasoner" model, which is designed to provide reasoning and code completion capabilities based on the context of your project.
4. **Select Code and/or Files**: Once the model is selected, you can choose parts of your code or entire files that you wish to send to the DeepSeek R1 model for analysis or assistance. This could be a function, a class, or any segment of code where you need suggestions or improvements.
5. **Send to the Model**: After selecting the desired code segments, proceed to send them to the DeepSeek R1 model. CodeGPT will then interact with the DeepSeek API to analyze your code and provide insights, suggestions, or even complete code snippets based on the context and the capabilities of the "deepseek-reasoner" model.

#### Key Takeaways and Best Practices
- **Ensure you are using the latest version of CodeGPT**: The integration with DeepSeek R1 may require the most recent updates to function correctly. Always keep your development tools updated.
- **Experiment with Different Models**: While this guide focuses on the "deepseek-reasoner" model, exploring other models provided by DeepSeek can offer different benefits and insights into your coding projects.
- **Understand the Capabilities and Limitations**: Be aware of what the DeepSeek R1 model can do for you. It's a powerful tool for code suggestions, debugging, and optimization, but understanding its limitations will help you use it more effectively.
