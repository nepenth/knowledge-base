#### Examples
For example, suppose we have an e-commerce database with tables for products, customers, and orders. Azimutt can help us explore the relationships between these tables, identify data inconsistencies, and create visualizations to represent sales trends.

```sql
-- Example database schema
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);
```

Using Azimutt, we can create a visualization to represent the relationship between products and orders, helping us identify top-selling products and trends in customer purchasing behavior.

#### Key Takeaways and Best Practices
When working with Azimutt, keep the following best practices in mind:

* **Start with a clear understanding of your database schema**: Before using Azimutt, make sure you have a good grasp of your database structure and relationships.
