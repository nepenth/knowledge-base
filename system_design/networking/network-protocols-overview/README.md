Network protocols are the backbone of modern computing and communication systems, facilitating data exchange between devices over the internet. This entry provides a comprehensive overview of eight fundamental network protocols, including HTTP, HTTP/3 (QUIC), HTTPS, WebSockets, TCP, UDP, SMTP, and FTP.

### Description
The infographic "8 Popular Network Protocols" presents a concise and easy-to-understand format for explaining each protocol's operation. The explanations are divided into three columns: **Protocol**, **How Does It Work?**, and **Use Cases**. Each protocol is represented by a distinct color scheme, making it easier to visualize the complex concepts.

### Technical Content
#### Protocols Covered

1. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: A request-response protocol used for transferring data over the internet.
	* **How Does It Work?**: Clients send requests to servers, which respond with the requested resources.
	* **Use Cases**: Web browsing, RESTful APIs.
2. **HTTP/3 (QUIC)**: A transport layer protocol designed to improve performance and security in HTTP communication.
	* **How Does It Work?**: Uses UDP as the underlying transport protocol, reducing latency and improving multiplexing.
	* **Use Cases**: High-performance web applications, real-time communication systems.
3. **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: An extension of HTTP that adds an extra layer of security using SSL/TLS encryption.
	* **How Does It Work?**: Encrypts data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering attacks.
	* **Use Cases**: Secure web browsing, online transactions, sensitive data exchange.
4. **WebSockets**: A protocol that enables bidirectional, real-time communication between clients and servers over the web.
	* **How Does It Work?**: Establishes a persistent connection, allowing for efficient, low-latency communication.
	* **Use Cases**: Real-time web applications, live updates, collaborative editing.
5. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A transport layer protocol that ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data packets.
	* **How Does It Work?**: Uses sequence numbers and acknowledgments to guarantee packet delivery.
	* **Use Cases**: File transfers, email, remote access.
6. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A transport layer protocol that prioritizes speed over reliability, suitable for applications that require low latency.
	* **How Does It Work?**: Sends data packets without guarantees of delivery or order.
	* **Use Cases**: Online gaming, video streaming, VoIP.
7. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol used for sending and receiving email messages between mail servers.
	* **How Does It Work?**: Relays email messages between servers, using a store-and-forward approach.
	* **Use Cases**: Email communication, mailing lists, automated notifications.
8. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol designed for transferring files over the internet.
	* **How Does It Work?**: Establishes a connection, allowing clients to upload or download files from servers.
	* **Use Cases**: File sharing, website updates, data backups.

### Key Takeaways and Best Practices
* Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each protocol to choose the best one for your application's needs.
* Use secure protocols like HTTPS and WebSockets to protect sensitive data and ensure confidentiality.
* Consider performance requirements when selecting between TCP and UDP.
* Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to handle packet loss or corruption.
