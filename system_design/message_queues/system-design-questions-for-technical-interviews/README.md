System design questions are an essential part of technical interviews, allowing candidates to demonstrate their problem-solving skills, knowledge of system architecture, and ability to design scalable systems. This entry provides a comprehensive overview of common system design questions, including Instagram design, YouTube design, Learning Management Systems (LMS), WhatsApp, Parking Lot systems, and URL shortening services.

## Technical Content
System design interviews typically involve designing a system or component from scratch, considering factors such as scalability, performance, reliability, and security. Here are some examples of common system design questions:

1. **Instagram Design**: Design a system that can handle a large number of users uploading and viewing photos. Consider the following components:
	* Load balancers to distribute incoming traffic
	* Application servers to handle user requests
	* Database servers to store user data and photo metadata
	* Cache layers to improve performance
2. **YouTube Design**: Design a system that can stream videos to a large number of users. Consider the following components:
	* Content delivery networks (CDNs) to distribute video content
	* Load balancers to distribute incoming traffic
	* Application servers to handle user requests
	* Database servers to store video metadata
3. **Learning Management Systems (LMS)**: Design a system that can manage online courses and track user progress. Consider the following components:
	* User authentication and authorization
	* Course catalog and search functionality
	* User enrollment and course completion tracking
4. **WhatsApp**: Design a system that can handle a large number of users sending and receiving messages. Consider the following components:
	* Load balancers to distribute incoming traffic
	* Application servers to handle user requests
	* Database servers to store message metadata
	* Cache layers to improve performance
5. **Parking Lot Systems**: Design a system that can manage parking lot inventory and track user payments. Consider the following components:
	* User authentication and authorization
	* Parking lot inventory management
	* Payment processing and tracking
6. **URL Shortening Services**: Design a system that can shorten URLs and redirect users to the original URL. Consider the following components:
	* Load balancers to distribute incoming traffic
	* Application servers to handle user requests
	* Database servers to store URL mappings

### Message Queues
Message queues are an essential component of many system designs, allowing for decoupling between producers and consumers of messages. There are two primary types of message queues: blocking and non-blocking.

#### Blocking Algorithm
A blocking algorithm uses locks to manage access to the queue. When a thread attempts to enqueue or dequeue an item, it acquires a lock on the queue. If the lock is not available, the operation is blocked until the lock can be obtained.

#### Non-Blocking Algorithm
A non-blocking algorithm uses atomic operations to ensure thread safety without blocking. Atomic operations allow multiple threads to access the queue simultaneously without conflicts. The CAS (Compare-and-Swap) instruction is used to update the queue's state atomically.

### Example: Non-Blocking Queue Enqueue Using CAS
The following example illustrates how to enqueue an item using atomic operations with CAS:
```java
public class NonBlockingQueue {
    private volatile Node head;
    private volatile Node tail;

    public void enqueue(Item item) {
        Node node = new Node(item);
        while (true) {
            Node currentTail = tail;
            Node currentNext = currentTail.next;
            if (currentTail == tail) {
                if (currentNext == null) {
                    if (compareAndSetNext(currentTail, node)) {
                        tail = node;
                        return;
                    }
                } else {
                    tail = currentNext;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private boolean compareAndSetNext(Node node, Node newNode) {
        return node.next.compareAndSet(null, newNode);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `enqueue` method uses a CAS operation to update the `next` field of the current tail node. If the update is successful, the new node is added to the queue.

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
* Consider scalability, performance, reliability, and security when designing systems.
* Use load balancers and caching layers to improve system performance.
* Implement message queues using non-blocking algorithms to avoid performance bottlenecks.
* Use atomic operations with CAS to ensure thread safety in concurrent systems.

**Description:** The infographic illustrates the design of a non-blocking queue, showcasing both blocking and non-blocking algorithms. The image is divided into three sections: "Blocking Algorithm," "Non-Blocking Algorithm," and "Non-Blocking Queue Enqueue Using CAS."

**Blocking Algorithm**

*   **Locking Mechanism**: This approach uses locks to manage access to the queue.
    *   A lock is acquired before attempting to enqueue or dequeue an item.
    *   If the lock is not available, the operation is blocked until the lock can be obtained.

**Non-Blocking Algorithm**

*   **Atomic Operations**: This method employs atomic operations to ensure thread safety without blocking.
    *   Atomic operations allow multiple threads to access the queue simultaneously without conflicts.
    *   The CAS (Compare-and-Swap) instruction is used to update the queue's state atomically.

**Non-Blocking Queue Enqueue Using CAS**

*   **Atomic Update**: This section demonstrates how to enqueue an item using atomic operations with CAS.
    *   The CAS instruction compares the current value of a pointer to the expected value and updates it if they match.
    *   If the update is successful, the new item is added to the queue.

The infographic effectively illustrates the differences between blocking and non-blocking algorithms for managing queues. By using atomic operations with CAS, the non-blocking algorithm ensures thread safety without introducing performance bottlenecks due to locking mechanisms.
