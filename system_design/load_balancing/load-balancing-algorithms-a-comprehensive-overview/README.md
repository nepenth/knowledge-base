Load balancing is a critical component of system design, ensuring efficient distribution of incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overload and improve responsiveness. This entry provides an in-depth examination of six key load balancing algorithms, including their features, characteristics, and use cases.

## Technical Content
The following sections delve into the details of each algorithm, exploring their strengths, weaknesses, and applications.

### 1. Round Robin Algorithm
The Round Robin algorithm directs incoming requests to the next available server in a rotation. This approach ensures that each server receives an equal number of requests, promoting fairness and preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

* **Example:** Suppose we have three servers (A, B, and C) and five incoming requests. The Round Robin algorithm would distribute these requests as follows:
	1. Request 1 -> Server A
	2. Request 2 -> Server B
	3. Request 3 -> Server C
	4. Request 4 -> Server A
	5. Request 5 -> Server B

### 2. Sticky Round Robin Algorithm
The Sticky Round Robin algorithm modifies the traditional Round Robin approach by consistently routing requests from the same client to the same server.

* **Example:** Building on the previous example, suppose Client X sends three requests. The Sticky Round Robin algorithm would direct these requests as follows:
	1. Request 1 (Client X) -> Server A
	2. Request 2 (Client X) -> Server A
	3. Request 3 (Client X) -> Server A

### 3. Weighted Round Robin Algorithm
The Weighted Round Robin algorithm assigns weights to each server, determining the number of requests it receives. Servers with higher weights receive more requests than those with lower weights.

* **Example:** Suppose we have three servers (A, B, and C) with weights 2, 3, and 1, respectively. The Weighted Round Robin algorithm would distribute five incoming requests as follows:
	1. Request 1 -> Server A
	2. Request 2 -> Server A
	3. Request 3 -> Server B
	4. Request 4 -> Server B
	5. Request 5 -> Server C

### 4. IP/URL Hash Algorithm
The IP/URL Hash algorithm maps each incoming request to a specific server based on its IP address or URL.

* **Example:** Suppose we have two servers (A and B) and two clients with IP addresses 192.168.1.100 and 192.168.1.200. The IP/URL Hash algorithm would direct requests as follows:
	1. Request (192.168.1.100) -> Server A
	2. Request (192.168.1.200) -> Server B

### 5. Least Connections Algorithm
The Least Connections algorithm directs requests to servers with the fewest active connections, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

* **Example:** Suppose we have three servers (A, B, and C) with 5, 3, and 2 active connections, respectively. The Least Connections algorithm would direct an incoming request as follows:
	1. Request -> Server C

### 6. Least Time Algorithm
The Least Time algorithm prioritizes servers based on their response times, directing requests to the fastest available server.

* **Example:** Suppose we have three servers (A, B, and C) with average response times of 100ms, 50ms, and 200ms, respectively. The Least Time algorithm would direct an incoming request as follows:
	1. Request -> Server B

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices
When selecting a load balancing algorithm, consider the following factors:

* **Traffic patterns:** Choose an algorithm that aligns with your expected traffic patterns.
* **Server resources:** Consider the available resources (e.g., CPU, memory) when selecting an algorithm.
* **Response time:** Opt for algorithms that prioritize response time, such as Least Time or IP/URL Hash.
