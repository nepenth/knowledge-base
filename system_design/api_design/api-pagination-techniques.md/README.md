### Description
When designing APIs that handle large datasets, proper pagination is crucial to prevent bottlenecks and ensure efficient data retrieval. This entry provides an overview of common pagination methods, implementation guidelines, and best practices for optimizing API performance.

### Technical Content
#### Common Pagination Methods
There are four primary pagination techniques used in API design:

1. **Offset-based Pagination**: This method relies on `limit` and `offset` parameters to paginate data. The `limit` parameter specifies the number of items to return, while the `offset` parameter defines the starting point in the dataset.
   * Example: `GET /items?limit=10&offset=20`
   * Returns 10 items starting from the 21st record.

2. **Cursor-based Pagination**: Instead of using numerical offsets, this method generates a cursor to identify the starting point for the next page. It's ideal for datasets with frequent additions or removals.
   * Example: `GET /items?cursor=abc123`
   * The server provides a cursor like `abc123` for the next page.

3. **Keyset-based Pagination**: This method uses a stable key (e.g., ID, timestamp) to paginate efficiently in large datasets, bypassing row counting and improving speed.
   * Example: `GET /items?after_id=100`
   * Retrieves items where the ID is greater than 100, leveraging indexed fields.

4. **Page-based Pagination**: This technique retrieves data using a page parameter (e.g., `?page=3`) to specify which subset of data to return.
   * Example: `GET /items?page=3`
Fetches the third page of results, with each page containing a predefined number of items.

#### Implementation Guidelines
To implement pagination in your API:

* Use offset-based pagination for simple use cases.
* Opt for cursor-based or keyset-based pagination for dynamic datasets.
* Document pagination parameters clearly to avoid confusion.

#### Common Pagination Mistakes
Avoid the following mistakes when implementing pagination:

1. **Neglecting the last page**: Ensure your API returns a clear response when users reach the final page of data.
2. **Failing to account for real-time data**: Use cursor-based or keyset-based pagination to avoid issues with missing or duplicated records in dynamic datasets.
3. **Ignoring documentation**: Clearly explain pagination parameters (limit, offset, cursor, page) in your API documentation.

### Key Takeaways and Best Practices
To optimize API performance and ensure efficient pagination:

1. **Optimize database queries**: Use indexes on fields you paginate (e.g., ID, timestamp).
2. **Set a maximum page size**: Protect your system by capping the number of items per page.
3. **Validate pagination parameters**: Ensure limit and offset values are valid to prevent errors.
4. **Maintain consistency across endpoints**: Keep pagination formats uniform to maintain ease of use and prevent confusion.

**Description:** The infographic, titled "API Pagination Techniques," presents a comprehensive overview of various pagination techniques used in API design. The title is prominently displayed at the top, followed by a series of interconnected graphics that illustrate the different methods.

**Key Features:**

* **Cursor-based:** This method uses an existing key to paginate data efficiently in large datasets.
* **Offset-based:** It limits and offsets the number of rows to be fetched from the database.
* **Page-based:** This technique utilizes a page number parameter to retrieve data.
* **No Pagination:** In this approach, all data is returned in a single request.
* **Keyset-based:** Existing keys are used to paginate data efficiently in large datasets.

**Visual Representation:**

The infographic features a central orange rectangle labeled "API Endpoint" with arrows pointing to each of the five pagination techniques. Each technique has its own distinct graphic and description, providing a clear understanding of how they work together to optimize API performance.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the infographic effectively communicates the importance of pagination in API design and provides a concise overview of the various techniques available. By highlighting the benefits and trade-offs of each approach, it serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to improve their API's efficiency and scalability.
