**Description:** The image presents a comparison between the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model, highlighting their differences in structure and function.

* **OSI Model**
	+ The OSI model is depicted on the left side of the image.
	+ It consists of seven layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical.
	+ Each layer has a specific function, such as data transmission, error detection, and routing.
* **TCP/IP Model**
	+ The TCP/IP model is shown on the right side of the image.
	+ It consists of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access.
	+ These layers are combined to form a protocol stack that enables communication between devices over the internet.

In summary, the OSI model provides a more detailed breakdown of network functions, while the TCP/IP model is a simplified version that focuses on the essential components for internet communication. The image effectively illustrates the differences between these two models, providing a clear understanding of their structures and functions.
